/**
 * How this deployment reaches one vendor: which protocol, from the kind `./access` resolved.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every connector used to be MCP, so "the transport" was an import. Google's Drive
 * MCP server turned out to be gated behind a developer preview, and the same product's ordinary REST
 * API is generally available — so one vendor needed a second way in, and a second way in wants a
 * seam rather than a branch at each call site.
 *
 * The interface STARTED as MCP's OWN: `listTools` and `callTool`, the two functions {@link ./mcp}
 * already exported, with the shapes it already used. That direction matters. Had the REST adapter
 * been given its own interface with MCP adapted to fit, MCP would have become a special case of a
 * shape invented for Drive. As it is, MCP is the contract the adapters conform to, which is why
 * swapping Drive back is one field on one catalogue entry and not a refactor.
 *
 * What has been added since is a SUPERSET of that shape rather than a departure from it, so an
 * MCP-shaped implementation still satisfies the seam unchanged. `listTools` answers `ListedTool[]`,
 * which is `McpTool` plus fields describing what a listing said about an action; the connection
 * carries an `actorId` and a `botId` for the transports whose authorization is the actor rather
 * than a credential; and one reserved key on `args` hands a transport the recorded version of the
 * action being called. Every addition is OPTIONAL, and that is what keeps an MCP-shaped
 * implementation an implementation of this interface rather than an exception to it.
 *
 * This paragraph used to say those fields were ones "a broker publishes and an MCP server does
 * not", and that `mcp.ts` therefore read none of them. Both were false: the MCP specification
 * defines `annotations.destructiveHint`, servers do publish it, and `mcp.ts` was dropping it — so a
 * tool a vendor declared destructive classified as a read wherever a curated write list omitted it.
 * `mcp.ts` now reads that hint, and deliberately does not read `readOnlyHint`, because a hint may
 * narrow what a Bot may do and may never widen it. The effect column is therefore not one
 * transport's vocabulary; it is what any listing was willing to say.
 *
 * There are exactly two call sites in the whole system — the tool listing and the tool call — and
 * both take a transport from here. Nothing else reads a `TransportKind` at all: the OAuth flow,
 * the grants, the policy engine and the audit trail are written without one. Whose credential a
 * row goes out on is a SEPARATE axis — `./access`'s `CredentialSource` — and that one is NOT
 * protocol-blind, since the brokered branch of the credential selection looks a person's
 * connection up in `composio_connections` by name. Read the blindness as a claim about this union
 * and not about the store.

   * Whether discovering the tool list needs somebody's credential.
   *
   * True for MCP, where the list is an answer from a remote server that will not give it up
   * unauthenticated. False whenever no credential has to be SELECTED for the listing: either
   * because the list is this code, as it is for Drive and Routines, or because the transport
   * already holds the one key it lists on and never receives it through the connection, as
   * Composio does — a broker publishes an action's schema to anybody who asks with the
   * deployment's own key.
   *
   * It is on the transport rather than assumed by the caller because getting it wrong is a whole
   * broken setup flow. Assumed true, an administrator configuring Drive was sent to their own
   * settings page to connect a personal account, purely so a token could be minted, passed to a
   * function that ignores it, and discarded — then sent back to press refresh. Nothing about that
   * sequence hinted that the middle step was doing no work.
