 * that wraps the same API is not equivalent: it is an extra party in the trust path with none of the
 * accountability, and the answer for a vendor without an official server is to wait for one.
 *
 * Every host and path here comes from the vendor's published documentation. They are pinned rather
 * than discovered, because a URL this deployment will hand a credential to is a reviewed source
 * contract.
 *
 * Admissibility is fail-closed and checked against the pinned host, never against what a caller
 * supplied. A URL that does not exactly match a pinned host, or match one anchored per-instance
 * pattern, is refused. This is the control that stops "add an MCP server" from being a request

/**
 * What this tool does, in the only two categories a policy author cares about.
 *
 * A RECORDED EFFECT MAY NARROW WHAT A BOT MAY DO AND MAY NEVER WIDEN IT. That is the criterion the
 * order below is built from, and it is why the reviewed write list is consulted FIRST. Both sources
 * are trusted to make an action a write; only the reviewed one is trusted to make an action a read
 * where the other says write. `writeTools` was read by a person before it shipped. A recorded effect
 * arrives from a vendor listing into a plain `text` column with no check constraint, so it is
 * whatever was last written there, by a refresh or by a hand on a psql prompt. A value in that column
 * therefore cannot take an action off the reviewed list.
 *
 * THREE SOURCES, CONSULTED IN THIS ORDER. Whether the server advertised the name at all: it did not,
 * the name came from a model and the answer is write, and nothing later overrides that. Then the
 * reviewed write list, which settles a name it holds as a write. Then what the vendor recorded, where
 * exactly `read` is a read and every other value it holds — a recorded write, an unrecognised label,
 * a different case, the empty string — is a write. Where the column holds nothing at all the reviewed
 * list finishes the job: an advertised name it declines to call a write is a read.
 *
 * Unknown counts as a write throughout. A server with no catalogue entry behind it is a write unless
 * the vendor recorded a read for that action — there is no reviewed list to consult, so an unlabelled
 * action of theirs has nothing saying it is safe.
 *
 * So there are two ways to earn a read, and both require somebody to have said so. Either the vendor
 * labelled the action a read and no reviewed list contradicts them, or the server advertised it and a
 * reviewed list declined to call it a write. Guessing permissively is recoverable only in those two
