 * than optional, and second rather than curried in beside the actor, because those are the two
 * shapes that cannot be forgotten — `resolveAttachmentParts` accepts a `(id) => …`, so a
 * `LoadAttachment` is deliberately NOT assignable to it, and the binding that adapts one to the

 * Records that these attachments went out in a message somebody sent.
 *
 * A closure bound to one person, like {@link LoadAttachment}, and for a stricter reason: this one
 * WRITES. `attachedAt` is what the sweeper, the upload cap and the withdrawal route all read as
 * "this file rode in a message somebody sent", so only the person whose send it was may record it,
 * and only for rows they uploaded themselves — see `markAttachmentsSent` in
 * channels/attachments.ts, which puts `uploadedBy` in the WHERE for exactly that.
 *
 * Called with the ids on the message being asked about and nothing else. History is replayed on
 * every turn and by whoever runs it, so a message behind the send is not evidence of one.
 *
 * A FAILURE TO RECORD REFUSES THE TURN, AND THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO PROMISE THE OPPOSITE. It said a
 * failure was swallowed and logged, because a turn is somebody waiting for an answer. The waiting
 * is real; the conclusion was not. {@link inlineAttachments} calls this BEFORE it returns the
 * history, and the history is what the run is given afterwards, so nothing has reached a model when
 * this resolves. A rejection here therefore costs a turn that never started, while a silent one
 * costs the file itself — `attachedAt` is what stops the culler reclaiming it, so a send recorded
 * nowhere is a message that displays a file the sweeper deletes a day later. The long argument, and
 * the four things that still do NOT reject, are in `markAttachmentsSent` in channels/attachments.ts.
 *
 * SO AN IMPLEMENTATION MUST RESOLVE ONLY WHEN THE RECORD IS DURABLE. Resolving because a statement
 * was accepted is not enough: an UPDATE that matched no row is a successful command in Postgres, so
 * an implementation that cannot distinguish "stamped" from "matched nothing" is reporting a send
 * that did not happen. It must also treat a row that is ALREADY sent as recorded, because a replayed
 * message and a retried run are both ordinary and neither is an error.
 *
 * REJECT WITH A SENTENCE, NOT A SYMPTOM. There is no `app.onError` behind this server, and what an
 * implementation throws travels out of the run as an AG-UI error and is shown to the person who was
 * waiting. It is the same road `resolvePart`'s refusals take, and it wants the same kind of message:
 * what happened, and what they can do about it.
 *
 * Absent still means nothing is recorded, which is what every deployment did before this existed.

 * they said; rewriting an assistant or tool message would be rewriting what a model already
 * produced. A message that refers to no attachment comes back BY IDENTITY, which is almost all of
 * them, so this pass costs nothing on a thread with no files in it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CATCHES, FOR THE MESSAGE BEING ASKED ABOUT. An attachment this deployment cannot load
 * fails that turn, deliberately: see `resolvePart` in `channels/attachment-parts.ts` for why a Bot
 * answering confidently about an image it never received is the worse of the two outcomes.
 *
 * THE MESSAGE BEING ASKED ABOUT IS THE LAST USER MESSAGE. Everything after it in `input.messages` is
 * the Bot's own work on this turn, and everything before it is a turn already answered; the last
 * thing a person said is what the run is a reply to, and so the only message whose attachments the
 * answer is going to be about. It is also the only one whose attachments were just uploaded, which
 * is what makes failing there recoverable: the person is still there, and can re-attach and re-send.
 *
 * OLDER MESSAGES DEGRADE INSTEAD. This maps over the WHOLE history, and history is replayed on every
 * turn, so one vanished row failing here would fail this channel's every future turn for ever — the
 * same geometry as the dangling tool call in `agents/history-sanitize.ts`, which opens by recording
 * that exact failure found in production twice: a permanent failure grown out of transient damage,
 * and nothing the person did wrong. It is reachable the same way, too: a send whose run is stopped
 * before the load never stamps `attachedAt`, and the sweeper deletes the row a day later. So an
 * older part whose row is gone becomes text saying so, which keeps the property that matters — the
 * model is never left to answer as though a file it cannot see were in front of it — without the
 * permanence.
 *
 * AND IT WALKS BACKWARDS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THE BUDGET FAIR. `MAX_INLINED_BYTES_PER_RUN` bounds
 * what one turn may inline in total — nothing did, before, and a channel that had seen a few large
 * images made every later turn read and base64 all of them again. A budget is only defensible if
 * the person's own question is never what it cuts, so the walk starts at the newest message: the
 * one being asked about is charged first, and is never cut whatever it costs. What runs out is the
 * room left for the history behind it, and that history has already been in front of the model
 * once, in the turn it arrived.
 *
 * NEVER CUT IS NOT THE SAME AS NEVER BOUNDED, and reading the first as the second is what left the
 * asked message with no ceiling at all: `resolvePart` stopped spending only under
 * `onMissing: "note"`, so a message a browser had just written could name two hundred
 * previously-sent files and inline every one of them. It is still never cut — a person is never
 * told their own question's attachment was quietly left out — but a message past
 * `MAX_INLINED_BYTES_PER_RUN` now fails this turn with a sentence naming the file and the limit.
 * Refusing is an answer somebody can act on, since the message is still in front of them; silently
 * serving half of it is not.
 *
 * The walk is sequential for the same reason the parts within a message are: a budget spent by
 * whichever database read happened to settle first would cut a different message on each run over
 * the same thread. The concurrency given up is one round trip per message that carries a file,
 * which is very few messages in very few threads.

     *
     * AFTER THE WHOLE HISTORY RESOLVES, NOT AFTER THIS MESSAGE DOES, which is why the ids are only
     * COLLECTED here and the write happens past the end of the loop. The strict `"fail"` above is
     * what refuses a turn that names a file the asker cannot see, and a send is not recorded for a
     * turn that never ran — but this loop walks BACKWARDS, so the asked message is the first thing
     * it resolves and every older message is still ahead of it. Stamping here meant stamping before

     * `"note"` softens a MISSING row, not a failing read) then failed the turn with `attachedAt`
     * already written for it. The stamp's entire meaning is "this file reached a message somebody
     * actually sent", and three readers act on it — the sweeper's delete, the upload cap, the
     * withdrawal route — so a stamp for a turn that never ran is not a cosmetic inaccuracy.
     *
     * Past the end of the loop is as late as this function can put it, and no later: whether the
     * model ever answers is decided by things well downstream of here, and a stamp that waited for
     * that would be waiting on something this function does not observe. What it can promise is
     * that every message this turn was going to inline was inlined first.
     *
     * AND IT IS NO LONGER CAUGHT HERE, WHICH IS THE REVERSAL OF WHAT THIS SEAM USED TO DO. A
     * `try`/`catch` stood around the call, holding {@link MarkAttachmentsSent}'s old promise that a
     * failure to record would never fail an answer. The promise was kept and the outcome was still
     * wrong: the run carried on to a model with a file whose `attachedAt` was never written, the
     * culler reclaimed the row a day later, and the message went on displaying an attachment that no
     * longer existed. Nobody was told, on either side.
     *
     * THE POINT IS *WHERE* THIS LINE SITS, and it is the reason refusing is affordable at all.
     * Everything above has resolved into `inlined`, and `inlined` is RETURNED — the run is handed to
     * `super.run` / `next.run` by the caller, after this function comes back. So a rejection on this
     * line happens with no model called, no token spent, and the person's message still in front of
     * them, which is the same position `resolvePart`'s `"fail"` refusal leaves them in a few lines
     * above. The turn is not yet spent, so the trade is not "an answer for a file" — it is a retry
     * for a file, and it is only available here.
     *
     * The implementation logs the actor and the ids; what it throws is a sentence naming the files
     * and what to do about them, and that sentence is what leaves through the run as an AG-UI error.
