/**
 * The Bot under test, or a failure that says it was never built.
 *
 * `agents["general-assistant"]?.run(...)` on an undefined agent never subscribes, so the promise
 * around that subscribe never settles and the test hangs to the suite's timeout with nothing in
 * the output naming the cause. A `buildAgents` that stopped returning this Bot is a failure to
 * report, not a five second wait. The optional-chaining form fails just as quietly without a
 * subscribe in play: `agent?.setMessages(...)` on an undefined agent is a no-op, and the assertions
 * after it then describe a Bot that was never run.
 *
 * AT MODULE SCOPE, not inside the describe that first needed it. Two describes reach for this — the
 * attachment one and the refused-conversation one — and while it lived in the first, the second
 * kept the `agent?.` shape it was written with, which is the whole failure above. A guard that has
 * to be copied to be used is a guard the next block will not have.

/**
 * The name a built-in Bot's runtime is asked for.
 *
 * This is the one model call in the process that composes a name rather than passing the configured
 * one through. `BOT_MODEL` overrides the package model whenever an OpenAI-compatible endpoint is
 * named, and a gateway's catalogue is namespaced, so the configured value is already `provider/model`
 * — prefixing it again asked for `openai/openai/gpt-5.6-sol`.
 *
 * Tested here rather than through a run because the failure has no signature at this layer: the
 * request is well formed and the vendor is the one that refuses it, so a test that only asserts
 * "a run happened" passes with the wrong name in it.
