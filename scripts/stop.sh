Usage: bash scripts/stop.sh [--keep-computers]

Stops the app, the routine worker, the API server, the Docker services, and each Bot's computer.

  --keep-computers  Leave the Bot computers running, so their browsers stay signed in and warm.
                    Their files and browser profiles are Docker volumes and survive either way.

Nothing was deleted. PostgreSQL, each Bot's files and each Bot's browser profile are Docker
volumes, so channels, credentials and signed-in sessions are all still there next time.

Start again: ./run-openbot.sh   (add --local to answer every model call on this Mac)
